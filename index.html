    <h1>The Darknet and the Future of Content Distribution</h1>

    <h2> 1 Introduction </h2>
    <p><b>People have always copied things. In the past, most items of value were physical objects.  Patent law and<br>
    economies of scale meant that small scale copying of physical objects was usually uneconomic, and large-<br>
    scale copying (if it infringed) was stoppable using policemen and courts.  Today, things of value are<br>
    increasingly less tangible: often they are just bits and bytes or can be accurately represented as bits and<br>
    bytes.</b></p>
    <p>The widespread deployment of packet-switched networks and the huge advances in computers and codec-<br>
    technologies has made it feasible (and indeed attractive) to deliver such digital works over the Internet.<br>
    This presents great opportunities and great challenges.  The opportunity is low-cost delivery of<br>
    personalized, desirable high-quality content.  The challenge is that such content can be distributed illegally.<br>
    Copyright law governs the legality of copying and distribution of such valuable data, but copyright<br>
    protection is increasingly strained in a world of programmable computers and high-speed networks.</p>
    <p align="center"><i>For example, consider the staggering burst of creativity by authors of computer programs that are designed<br>
    to share audio files.  This was first popularized by Napster, but today several popular applications and<br>
    services offer similar capabilities.  CD-writers have become mainstream, and DVD-writers may well follow<br>
    suit.  Hence, even in the absence of network connectivity, the opportunity for low-cost, large-scale file<br>
    sharing exists.</i></p>
    <h2> 2 The Darknet </h2>
    <p>Throughout this paper, we will call the shared items (e.g. software programs, songs, movies, books, etc.)<br>
    objects. <u>The persons who copy objects</u> will be called users of the darknet, and the computers used to share<br>
    objects will be called hosts.</p>
    <p>The darknet is the distribution network that emerges from the injection of objects according to assumption<br>
    1 and the distribution of <strong> those objects according to assumptions 2 and 3. </strong></p>
    <p>One implication of the first assumption is that any content protection system will leak popular or<br>
    interesting content into the darknet, because some fraction of users--possibly experts-will overcome any<br>
    copy prevention mechanism or because the object will enter the darknet before copy protection occurs.</p>
    <p><strong>The term &quotwidely distributed&quot </strong> is intended to capture the notion of mass market distribution of objects to<br>
    thousands or millions of practically anonymous users. <em><u>This is in contrast to the protection of military,</u></em><br>
    industrial, or personal secrets, which are typically not widely distributed and are not the focus of this paper.</p>
    <h3>2.1 Central Internet Servers</h3>
    <p>By 1998, a new form of the darknet began to emerge from technological advances in several areas. The<br>
    internet had become mainstream, and as such its protocols and infrastructure could now be relied upon by<br>
    anyone seeking to connect users with a centralized service or with each other. The continuing fall in the<br>
    price of storage together with advances in compression technology had also crossed the threshold at which<br>
    storing large numbers of audio files was no longer an obstacle to mainstream users. Additionally, the power<br>
    of computers had crossed the point at which they could be used as rendering devices for multimedia<br>
    content. Finally, &quotCD ripping&quot became a trivial method for content injection.</p>
    <img src="1.jpg" align="left"><p><b><i>&nbspThe first embodiments of this new darknet were central<br>
    &nbspinternet servers with large collections of MP3 audio files. A<br>
    &nbspfundamental change that came with these servers was<br>
    &nbspthe use of a new distribution network: The internet displaced the<br>
    &nbspsneaker net - at least for audio content. This solved several<br>
    &nbspproblems of the old darknet.  First, latency was reduced<br>
    &nbspdrastically.</i></b></p> &nbspSecondly, and more importantly, discovery of objects became<br>
    much easier because of simple and powerful search mechanisms - most importantly the general-purpose<br>
    world-wide-web search engine. The local view of the small world was replaced by a global view of the<br>
    entire collection accessible by all users. The main characteristic of this form of the darknet was centralized<br>
    storage and search - a simple architecture that mirrored mainstream internet servers.
    <h3>2.2 Central Internet Servers</h3>
    <p align="right"><i>Centralized or quasi-centralized distribution and service networks make sense for legal online commerce.<br>
    Bandwidth and infrastructure costs tend to be low, and having customers visit a commerce site means the<br>
    merchant can display adverts, collect profiles, and bill efficiently.  Additionally, management, auditing, and<br>
    accountability are much easier in a centralized model.</i></p>
    <div align="center"><img src="2.jpg"></div>
    <p>However, centralized schemes work poorly for illegal object distribution because large, central servers are<br>
    large single points of failure: If the distributor is breaking the law, it is relatively easy to force him to stop.<br>
    Early MP3 Web and FTP sites were commonly &quothosted&quot by universities, corporations, and ISPs.  Copyright-<br>
    holders or their representatives sent &quotcease and desist&quot letters to these web-site operators and web-<br>
    owners citing copyright infringement and in a few cases followed up with legal action [15].  The threats<br>
    of legal action were successful attacks on those centralized networks, and MP3 web and FTP sites disappeared<br>
    from the mainstream shortly after they appeared.</p>
